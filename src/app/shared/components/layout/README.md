# Board Layout Component Implementation

## Overview
This implementation provides a responsive Material Design layout for the `/board` path and its sub-routes. The layout follows Angular best practices, SOLID principles, and includes a modern responsive design.

## Architecture

### Layout Component (`/shared/components/layout/`)
- **Main Layout Container**: Uses Angular Material's `mat-sidenav-container` for responsive sidebar layout
- **Header**: Fixed toolbar with navigation toggle and user actions
- **Sidebar**: Collapsible navigation menu with routing support
- **Footer**: Simple footer with links and copyright information
- **Responsive Design**: Automatically adapts to mobile and desktop screens

### Component Structure
```
src/app/
├── shared/components/layout/
│   ├── layout.component.ts      # Main layout component with responsive logic
│   ├── layout.component.html    # Template with Material Design components
│   └── layout.component.scss    # Comprehensive styling including dark theme
├── board/                       # Board section components
│   ├── dashboard/dashboard.component.ts
│   ├── projects/projects.component.ts
│   ├── tasks/tasks.component.ts
│   ├── analytics/analytics.component.ts
│   └── settings/settings.component.ts
```

## Features

### Responsive Layout
- **Desktop**: Side navigation always visible
- **Mobile/Tablet**: Navigation slides over content with backdrop
- **Breakpoint Detection**: Automatic layout adjustments using Angular CDK

### Material Design Components Used
- `MatSidenavModule` - Responsive sidebar navigation
- `MatToolbarModule` - Fixed header with actions
- `MatListModule` - Navigation menu items
- `MatIconModule` - Material icons throughout
- `MatButtonModule` - Action buttons
- `MatCardModule` - Content cards in board sections

### SOLID Principles Implementation

#### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- Layout component only handles layout structure and responsive behavior
- Each board component focuses on its specific domain (dashboard, projects, etc.)

#### Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
- Layout is open for extension through child routes
- New board sections can be added without modifying existing code

#### Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
- Components implement consistent interfaces
- Proper inheritance patterns used

#### Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
- Small, focused interfaces for component communication
- Components only depend on methods they use

#### Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
- Uses Angular's dependency injection system
- Services injected using the modern `inject()` function

### Modern Angular Patterns

#### Signals (Angular 17+)
```typescript
public readonly isSidenavOpen = signal<boolean>(true);
public readonly isHandset = signal<boolean>(false);
public readonly sidenavMode = computed(() => this.isHandset() ? 'over' : 'side');
```

#### Standalone Components
- All components are standalone for better tree-shaking
- Modular imports for better performance

#### OnPush Change Detection
- Optimized performance with OnPush strategy
- Reactive programming with RxJS

## Routing Configuration

### Board Routes
```typescript
{
  path: 'board',
  component: LayoutComponent,
  children: [
    { path: '', redirectTo: 'dashboard', pathMatch: 'full' },
    { path: 'dashboard', component: DashboardComponent },
    { path: 'projects', component: ProjectsComponent },
    { path: 'tasks', component: TasksComponent },
    { path: 'analytics', component: AnalyticsComponent },
    { path: 'settings', component: SettingsComponent },
  ],
}
```

### Navigation Structure
- `/board` → Redirects to `/board/dashboard`
- `/board/dashboard` → Dashboard overview
- `/board/projects` → Project management
- `/board/tasks` → Task tracking
- `/board/analytics` → Data visualization
- `/board/settings` → Application settings

## Styling Features

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach
- Breakpoint-based layout adjustments
- Flexible grid systems

### Theme Support
- Light theme (default)
- Dark theme support with CSS media queries
- Material Design color palette

### Accessibility
- ARIA labels and roles
- Keyboard navigation support
- Focus management
- Screen reader compatibility

## Usage

### Accessing the Board
1. Navigate to the root path `/`
2. Click the "Open Board" button in the Development Dashboard
3. Or directly navigate to `/board`

### Navigation
- Use the sidebar menu to navigate between sections
- On mobile, tap the menu button to open/close sidebar
- Clicking any navigation item on mobile automatically closes the sidebar

## Development Notes

### Adding New Board Sections
1. Create a new component in `/app/board/[section-name]/`
2. Add the route to `app.routes.ts` under the board children
3. Add a navigation item to the sidebar in `layout.component.html`

### Customization
- Modify colors in the SCSS variables
- Adjust breakpoints in the component logic
- Add new Material Design components as needed

### Performance Considerations
- OnPush change detection for optimal performance
- Lazy loading ready (can be converted to lazy-loaded modules)
- Tree-shaking optimized with standalone components

## Material Design Compliance
This implementation follows Material Design 3 principles:
- Consistent spacing and typography
- Proper use of elevation and shadows
- Accessible color contrast ratios
- Touch-friendly interactive elements
- Smooth animations and transitions
